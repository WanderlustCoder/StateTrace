# Code review decision log (2026-01-09)

Record scope/test/telemetry decisions and any approved deferrals.

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact | Approved by | Follow-up |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 2026-01-09 | Review-only pass; fixes deferred until findings are triaged. | User requested full review before remediation. | Tests/harnesses deferred until fixes are scoped. | Codex | Run test matrix after remediation plan is agreed. |
| 2026-01-09 | Skip deep review of historical session logs/performance snapshots. | Evidence artifacts are out of scope per review scope. | Logs/performance docs not evaluated for content accuracy. | Codex | Review artifacts only if required for release evidence. |
| 2026-01-09 | Proceed with targeted remediations and unit test run; defer pipeline/harness and doc-sync checks. | Production readiness required Pester coverage; fixtures for DiffPrototype/Telemetry bundle are missing. | Unit tests executed; telemetry gates and doc-sync evidence remain pending. | Codex | Restore fixtures, run pipeline/warm regression, then run doc-sync checklist. |
| 2026-01-09 | Defer scheduler polling backoff improvement (CR-003). | Low severity and higher risk of unintended scheduler behavior changes. | Fixed polling remains; revisit if scheduler telemetry shows idle overhead. | Codex | Re-evaluate after release readiness gates complete. |
| 2026-01-09 | Treat runtime `.accdb` removal as a gating hygiene task. | Data hygiene policy requires removing runtime databases before production. | Deletions must be committed before release. | Codex | Confirm deletions land before shipping. |
| 2026-01-10 | Do not bypass the port batch diversity guard after the pipeline failure. | Guard failure indicates a telemetry gate violation; bypassing would mask readiness issues. | Pipeline remains blocked until diversity is corrected. | Codex | Re-run after fixing PortBatchReady sequencing. |
| 2026-01-10 | Defer verification harness run until port batch diversity + warm-run gates pass. | Running verification harness now would re-run the failing pipeline and not produce actionable readiness evidence. | Verification summary not generated for this pass. | Codex | Run `Tools/Invoke-StateTraceVerification.ps1` after CR-038/CR-039 are resolved. |
| 2026-01-10 | Run verification harness and split shared cache diagnostics windows (store run span; provider warm pass). | Provider reasons should reflect warm pass cache coverage and avoid cold-pass AccessRefresh. | Verification harness evidence captured; shared cache diagnostics pass. | Codex | Update evidence log, gate checklist, and findings report. |
| 2026-01-10 | Publish telemetry bundle (Telemetry + Routing) and record readiness summary; remove runtime .accdb files. | Plan G readiness requires bundle verification and data hygiene gates. | Telemetry bundle readiness summary created; runtime .accdb files removed. | Codex | Update Plan G, TaskBoard, backlog, and findings report. |
| 2026-01-10 | Run unit tests in Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell.exe`). | Pester 3 under `pwsh` reports false Should Throw failures. | Unit test evidence recorded from Windows PowerShell 5.1. | Codex | Use `powershell.exe` for future Pester evidence. |
| 2026-01-10 | Run Access maintenance (compaction + index audit) before re-running pipeline to reduce DB write latency. | DatabaseWriteLatency p95 remained above gate. | Backups created and maintenance logs recorded. | Codex | Re-run pipeline and rollup metrics. |
| 2026-01-10 | Attempt concurrency overrides (ThreadCeilingOverride 6, MaxWorkersPerSiteOverride 2) to reduce write latency. | Reduce Access write contention during parsing. | Override run completed; overrides reset by guard. | Codex | Evaluate other mitigations since p95 remained above gate. |
| 2026-01-10 | Use Review-20260110-101639 telemetry run as primary gate evidence. | Lowest DatabaseWriteLatency p95 among recent runs; parse duration pass. | Rollup summary and Plan H simulation reference this run. | Codex | Update plan/taskboard/evidence with Review-20260110-101639 paths. |
| 2026-01-10 | Use Review-20260110-DbLatency3-20260110-114623 telemetry run for DatabaseWriteLatency gate evidence. | Cold pass shows DatabaseWriteLatency p95 174.6 ms, AccessRefresh 0, shared cache store GetHit 39 / GetMiss 0. | DatabaseWriteLatency gate evidence updated; PortBatch diversity guard failed due to missing PortBatchReady events in this run. | Codex | Keep Review-20260110-101639 for warm-run evidence and verification harness inputs. |
