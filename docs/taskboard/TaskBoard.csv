"ST-B-001","Investigate WLLS snapshot/materialize regression","In Progress","Ingestion/Performance","DeviceRepository now hydrates shared cache snapshots automatically. 2025-11-28 pipeline + incremental checklist refreshed telemetry (SnapshotImported=3, InitNewStore=15, InitReuseStore=6, GetMiss=50/GetHit=24); WLLS AccessCacheHit=5/AccessRefresh=0; BOYO providers still Unknown; queue delay summary skipped (0 samples); PortBatchReady remains synthetic/minimal (1 sw1 batch) after dispatcher sweep (Logs/DispatchHarness/RoutingQueueSweep-checklist-20251128-095600.json). 2025-12-17: TelemetryModule now batches telemetry writes (flush-on ParseDuration/SkippedDuplicate) and ParserPersistenceModule reuses shared-cache entries to avoid redundant GetHit calls; Quick mock BOYO/WLLS pipeline now ~7s wall time with ParseDuration ~2.4s/0.35s and DatabaseWriteLatency ~290ms/99ms. 2025-12-20: Warm regression attempt failed the port batch diversity guard (WLLS streak 19 > limit 8); warm pass aborted.
