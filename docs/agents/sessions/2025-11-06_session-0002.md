# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-06
- **Role:** Automation
- **Task board card:** Archive shared-cache summaries during scheduled verification

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Review existing shared-cache snapshot outputs to confirm current coverage (WLLS-only) and identify artefacts the scheduler should capture.
- Update `Tools/Invoke-StateTraceScheduledVerification.ps1` so every run archives the latest shared-cache summary JSON alongside the transcript, reinforcing Documentation Primacy.
- Record the automation change on the task board and in session notes to keep Plan-first collaboration in sync.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - Tools/Invoke-StateTraceScheduledVerification.ps1
  - docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md
  - docs/agents/sessions/2025-11-06_session-0002.md
- Rationale:
  - Scheduler now resolves the snapshot directory, copies the newest `SharedCacheSnapshot-*-summary.json` and `SharedCacheSnapshot-latest-summary.json` into `Logs/Verification`, and exposes the archive paths through PassThru metadata so CI can ingest them; documentation updated to reflect the workflow.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (PowerShell script + docs update).
- Smoke run (if applicable): Not run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Broaden snapshot coverage beyond WLLS during the next ingestion dry-run so the archived summaries represent multiple sites.
