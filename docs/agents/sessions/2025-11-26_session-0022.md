# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** Tooling
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001, ST-H-003

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Fix Plan H readiness enforcement when `-VerifyPlanHReadiness` is used with the bundle publisher.

## Changes
- `Tools/Publish-TelemetryBundle.ps1` now calls `Tools/Test-PlanHReadiness.ps1` with `-PassThru` so readiness checks no longer fail on null results.

## Validation
- Not re-run after the fix (prior attempt failed on null readiness result); ready for next bundle publish.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Re-run bundle publish with `-VerifyPlanHReadiness -Force` to regenerate a validated bundle; ensure future publishes succeed.
