# 2025-10-03 - Agent Session 0001

## Plan
- Re-run the 37-log ingestion pipeline after persistence batching.
- Extract ParseDuration and DatabaseWriteLatency telemetry to evaluate Plan B KPIs.
- Update Plan B documentation and task board with results and follow-ups.

## Changes
- `docs/StateTrace_Consolidated_Plans.md`: added 2025-10-03 stress-test snapshot and refreshed follow-up status.
- `docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md`: populated the Ready column with Plan B follow-up cards.
- Ran the ingestion pipeline; no module edits required in this session.

## Validation
- `Tools/Invoke-StateTracePipeline.ps1 -SkipTests -VerboseParsing`
- Calculated parse/write p95 from `Logs/IngestionMetrics/2025-10-03.json` (05:10 MT autoscale profile window).
- Spot-checked updated docs for formatting locally.

## Outcome
- Plan B KPIs still unmet (ParseDuration p95 ~4.14 s, DatabaseWriteLatency p95 ~3.45 s).
- Follow-up work staged for Access batching telemetry, spool reset helper, and concurrency tuning.
