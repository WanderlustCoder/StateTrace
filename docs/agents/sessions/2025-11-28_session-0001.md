# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-28
- **Role:** Telemetry / Docs
- **Task board card:** ST-H-003 (Plan H) – Instrument user-facing telemetry

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Add a runbook for generating/attaching UserAction summaries (Documentation Primacy).
- Keep it bundle-friendly and align with the Plan H gate.
- Update the plan timeline accordingly.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - docs/runbooks/UserAction_Telemetry.md
  - docs/plans/PlanH_UserExperience.md
- Rationale:
  - Documented how to run the UserAction analyzer and attach outputs to telemetry bundles.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (docs only).
- Smoke run: Not run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Integrate the analyzer into bundle automation and run it on the latest telemetry before closing ST-H-003.
