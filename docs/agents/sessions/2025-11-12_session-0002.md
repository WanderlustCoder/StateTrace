# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-12
- **Role:** Telemetry/Automation
- **Task board card:** ST-E-002 – Automate metric rollup schedule

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Build a lightweight wrapper around Tools/Rollup-IngestionMetrics.ps1 that filters the latest N days and writes timestamped CSV files.
- Update README + Codex Runbook so the new script is discoverable for daily automation and align Plan E/task board/backlog.
- Record the work in Plan E and mark ST-E-002 as delivered.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - Tools/Invoke-DailyMetricRollup.ps1
  - docs/README.md
  - docs/CODEX_RUNBOOK.md
  - docs/plans/PlanE_Telemetry.md
  - docs/CODEX_BACKLOG.md
  - docs/taskboard/TaskBoard.csv
  - docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md
- Rationale:
  - Provide a one-command daily rollup harness, document the workflow, and close out the Plan E automation task.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (script relies on existing Rollup cmdlet; manual inspection only).
- Smoke run (if applicable): Not run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Consider scheduling the new script via Task Scheduler/CI once infra requirements are clarified.
