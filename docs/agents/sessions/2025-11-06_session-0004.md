# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-06
- **Role:** Automation
- **Task board card:** Added Tools/Invoke-SharedCacheWarmup.ps1 to validate snapshot coverage

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Introduce a warmup helper that executes the pipeline, surfaces shared-cache summaries, and enforces coverage so operators can populate multi-site snapshots before verification.
- Reuse the new shared-cache coverage check to keep automation policy consistent.
- Document the workflow (README, task board) and capture the session per Documentation Primacy.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - Tools/Invoke-SharedCacheWarmup.ps1
  - Tools/Invoke-StateTraceVerification.ps1
  - Tools/Invoke-StateTraceScheduledVerification.ps1
  - docs/README.md
  - docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md
  - docs/agents/sessions/2025-11-06_session-0004.md
- Rationale:
  - Provides a single entry point for priming the shared cache, validates coverage against policy thresholds, and records the automation in project docs.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not applicable (new orchestration script).
- Smoke run (if applicable): Not run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: After priming BOYO/WLLS snapshots, bump the warmup helper’s default `MinimumSiteCount` and verification thresholds to reflect multi-site coverage.
