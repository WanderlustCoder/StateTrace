# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** Telemetry / Tooling
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001, ST-H-003

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Add a one-shot Plan H readiness/report runner and document it.

## Changes
- New helper: `Tools/Invoke-PlanHChecks.ps1` runs `Check-PlanHStatus` (readiness) and generates a markdown report via `Generate-PlanHReport`.
- Runbook (`docs/CODEX_RUNBOOK.md`) updated with the combined checks/report command.

## Validation
- Not executed yet; ready for next bundle CI or pre-release check.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Use the helper to gate Plan H readiness and produce reports automatically for future bundles.
