# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-27
- **Role:** Telemetry
- **Task board card:** ST-H-003 (Plan H) – Instrument user-facing telemetry

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Provide a lightweight analyzer for UserAction telemetry to support adoption rollups.
- Keep it optional and bundle-friendly.
- Note progress in Plan H.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - Tools/Analyze-UserActionTelemetry.ps1
  - docs/plans/PlanH_UserExperience.md
- Rationale:
  - New analyzer summarizes UserAction counts by action/site (with optional JSON output) so bundles/rollups can capture adoption signals; Plan H timeline updated.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (new script).
- Smoke run: Not run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Integrate analyzer into rollups/telemetry bundles and run it against latest logs when closing ST-H-003.
