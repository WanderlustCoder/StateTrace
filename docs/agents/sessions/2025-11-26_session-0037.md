# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** UI / Telemetry (planning)
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001, ST-H-003

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Provide an interactive capture runbook since the current environment is non-interactive.

## Changes
- Added `docs/runbooks/PlanH_UI_Capture_Local.md` outlining the steps to capture live WPF evidence (freshness tooltip/help/Interfaces), emit cache-provider telemetry, and publish a readiness-enforced bundle.

## Validation
- Documentation-only update (UI launch attempted but blocked by non-interactive session).

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Run the capture steps on a desktop-capable environment to refresh screenshots and telemetry, then publish a new bundle with `Tools/Invoke-PlanHBundle.ps1 -Force`.
