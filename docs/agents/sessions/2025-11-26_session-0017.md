# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** Tooling / Telemetry
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001, ST-H-003

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Add a Plan H readiness checker to validate bundles (UserAction + freshness evidence).
- Document the new check in the Codex runbook.

## Changes
- New tool: `Tools/Test-PlanHReadiness.ps1` validates that a bundle (or supplied paths) includes UserAction coverage (all required actions) and a freshness telemetry summary.
- Runbook update: `docs/CODEX_RUNBOOK.md` now lists the readiness check command and notes to gate Plan H updates on it.

## Validation
- Not run yet; intended for next bundle verification run (use `-BundlePath Logs/TelemetryBundles/<bundle>`).

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Run the readiness checker on the next UI bundle to gate Plan H; expand required checks if new evidence types are added.
