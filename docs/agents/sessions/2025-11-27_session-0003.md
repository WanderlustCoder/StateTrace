# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-27
- **Role:** UI / Telemetry
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001 – Launch user onboarding + freshness visibility

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Emit user-action telemetry for key onboarding actions (Scan Logs, Load from DB).
- Keep changes minimal and safe if telemetry module is absent.
- Note progress in Plan H timeline.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - Main/MainWindow.ps1
- Rationale:
  - Added `Publish-UserActionTelemetry` helper and emit `UserAction` events for Scan Logs and Load from DB with site/host context; safe no-op if telemetry module unavailable.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (small UI telemetry hook).
- Smoke run: Not run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done (incremental progress on ST-H-001/ST-H-003 groundwork)
- Follow-ups: Emit telemetry for Compare/Span, capture screenshots, and wire rollups before closing ST-H-001/003.
