# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** Docs / Telemetry
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001, ST-H-003

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Tighten UI checklist expectations for the freshness tooltip (provider/reason).
- Add a runbook entry for the freshness telemetry analyzer to the Codex runbook.

## Changes
- `docs/UI_Smoke_Checklist.md` now asks for hovering the freshness label to confirm provider/source in the tooltip.
- `docs/CODEX_RUNBOOK.md` includes the freshness telemetry analyzer command and guidance for Plan H evidence.

## Validation
- Documentation-only updates; no commands executed beyond file edits.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Capture live WPF screenshots showing the freshness tooltip with provider info; keep including freshness summaries in UI bundles.
