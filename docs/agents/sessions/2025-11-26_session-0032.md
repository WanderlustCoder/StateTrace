# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** Tooling
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001, ST-H-003

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Fix the Plan H bundle helper to be PowerShell-safe and reliable on paths.

## Changes
- `Tools/Invoke-PlanHBundle.ps1`: removed invalid `??` usage, now resolves reports directory, generates UserAction/Freshness summaries with module-local scripts, and ensures paths exist before publishing.

## Validation
- Not executed yet; intended for next bundle run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Use the helper on the next UI telemetry run to publish a readiness-enforced bundle.
