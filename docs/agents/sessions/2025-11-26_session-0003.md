# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** UI / Docs
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001 – Launch user onboarding + freshness visibility

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Wire toolbar Help to the quickstart anchor so operators land on the onboarding path (Documentation Primacy).
- Keep changes minimal to avoid disrupting existing help content.
- Update Plan H timeline after the hook is in place.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - Main/MainWindow.ps1
  - docs/plans/PlanH_UserExperience.md
- Rationale:
  - Help button now opens the Operators Runbook quickstart anchor before showing the help window, making onboarding discoverable; timeline updated to record progress.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (small UI hook change).
- Smoke run: Not run (no visual changes exercised).

## Outcome
- Status: Done (incremental progress on ST-H-001)
- Follow-ups: Implement freshness banner + adoption telemetry; capture screenshots and smoke evidence for closure.
