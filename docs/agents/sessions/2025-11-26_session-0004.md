# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** UI
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001 – Launch user onboarding + freshness visibility

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Surface ingestion freshness in the UI using existing data (Documentation Primacy, Telemetry & verification).
- Keep the change low-risk (toolbar label + lookup against IngestionHistory).
- Update smoke checklist and plan timeline to reflect the new expectation.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - Main/MainWindow.xaml
  - Main/MainWindow.ps1
  - docs/UI_Smoke_Checklist.md
  - docs/plans/PlanH_UserExperience.md
- Rationale:
  - Added a toolbar freshness label showing the last ingest timestamp/age for the selected site by reading `Data/IngestionHistory/<site>.json`; tied it into site selection and initial load. Updated docs to test/track the new UI element.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (UI/doc change only).
- Smoke run: Not run (headless checklist not executed in this pass).

## Outcome
- Status: Done (incremental progress on ST-H-001)
- Follow-ups: Expand freshness indicator to include cache provider source, capture screenshots, and add telemetry before closing ST-H-001.
