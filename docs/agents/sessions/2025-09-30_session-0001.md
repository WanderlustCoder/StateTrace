# 2025-09-30 – Agent Session 0001

## Plan
- Pull **Emit core telemetry in parser** from Ready.
- Add metric emission hooks and minimal tests.
- Run a local replay and capture metrics.

## Changes
- (to be filled by agent)

## Validation
- Unit tests: pass/fail with counts.
- Metrics file: path and sample of 1–2 events.

## Outcome
- Move card to **In Progress** or **Done**; otherwise mark **Blocked** with reason.
