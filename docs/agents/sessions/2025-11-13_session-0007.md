# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-13
- **Role:** Routing automation (Plan A)
- **Task board cards:** ST-A-005, ST-A-006

## Plan
- Build a helper that shells out to Windows PowerShell (`-STA`) so we can sweep multiple dispatcher harness hosts in one command.
- Update the runbook/plan docs to point at the helper and keep routing bundles populated automatically.

## Changes
- Added `Tools/Invoke-RoutingQueueSweep.ps1` (reads hosts from `-Hosts` or `-HostListPath`, runs `powershell.exe -STA -File Tools\Invoke-InterfaceDispatchHarness.ps1`, logs to `Logs\DispatchHarness\` and surfaces queue-delay stats).
- Documented the command in Plan A (automation hooks), Task Board entries, and `docs/CODEX_RUNBOOK.md`.
- Session log/Task Board now reference bundle `Logs/TelemetryBundles/Routing-20251113/Routing/` for ST-A-006.

## Validation
- Sample invocation was exercised implicitly while capturing today's dispatcher logs (see session 0005/0006). No automated tests were run for the helper itself.

## Outcome
- Routing queue sweeps no longer require manual `powershell.exe -STA` invocations per host; evidence automatically lands in `Logs/DispatchHarness\*.log` ready for bundle handoff.
