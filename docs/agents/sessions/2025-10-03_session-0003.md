# 2025-10-03 - Agent Session 0003

## Plan
- Confirm Plan B targets and concurrency settings before rerun.
- Execute the 37-device ingestion benchmark with verbose telemetry and spool reset.
- Analyze Plan B metrics, refresh documentation, and queue follow-up actions.

## Changes
- `docs/StateTrace_Consolidated_Plans.md`: added the 2025-10-03 stress-test snapshot and updated follow-ups with Access latency and duplicate suppression actions.
- `docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md`: moved completed instrumentation cards to Done and added Ready items for Access commit latency analysis and duplicate-run suppression.

## Validation
- `Tools/Invoke-StateTracePipeline.ps1 -VerboseParsing -ResetExtractedLogs`
- Parsed `Logs/IngestionMetrics/2025-10-03.json` to compute ParseDuration and DatabaseWriteLatency distributions.

## Outcome
- Autoscale resolved at ThreadCeiling=8 and MaxWorkersPerSite=4; ParseDuration p95 ~4.83 s and DatabaseWriteLatency p95 ~4.08 s remain above Plan B targets.
- Logged new Plan B snapshot and queued next steps to reduce WLLS Access commit latency and prevent duplicate-only reruns.
