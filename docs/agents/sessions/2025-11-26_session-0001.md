# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** Docs
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001 – Launch user onboarding + freshness visibility

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Review existing plans/task board/backlog for end-user value gaps (Documentation Primacy, Plan-first Collaboration).
- Draft a new user experience/adoption plan with initial tasks and telemetry hooks (Documentation Primacy).
- Register the new plan on the plan index, task board, CSV, and backlog (Telemetry & verification, Security & data hygiene).

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - docs/plans/PlanH_UserExperience.md
  - docs/plans/PlanIndex.md
  - docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md
  - docs/taskboard/TaskBoard.csv
  - docs/CODEX_BACKLOG.md
  - docs/StateTrace_Consolidated_Plans.md
- Rationale:
  - Added Plan H to drive user-facing usefulness (onboarding, freshness indicators, user-action telemetry) and aligned task board/backlog entries for automation visibility.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (docs-only planning work).
- Smoke run (if applicable): Not run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: ST-H-001 ready to start (publish onboarding path + freshness banner); ST-H-002/ST-H-003 tracked in Plan H for subsequent telemetry/UI work.
