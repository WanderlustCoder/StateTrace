# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-06
- **Role:** Automation
- **Task board card:** Scheduled verification now archives shared-cache summaries

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Extend verification tooling to evaluate shared-cache coverage so the nightly job flags missing site snapshots (Documentation Primacy).
- Add reusable coverage assertions to `Modules/VerificationModule.psm1` plus Pester tests to guard policy drift (Telemetry & verification).
- Wire the verification and scheduled harnesses to surface coverage results, archive the JSON summaries, and make the thresholds configurable for operators.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - Modules/VerificationModule.psm1
  - Modules/Tests/VerificationModule.Tests.ps1
  - Tools/Invoke-StateTraceVerification.ps1
  - Tools/Invoke-StateTraceScheduledVerification.ps1
  - docs/README.md
  - docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md
  - docs/agents/sessions/2025-11-06_session-0003.md
- Rationale:
  - Introduced `Test-SharedCacheSummaryCoverage`, updated verification scripts to call it with tunable thresholds, surfaced evaluation results (and archived summaries) in scheduled runs, and documented the new switches for operators.

## Validation
- Unit tests: `Invoke-Pester Modules/Tests/VerificationModule.Tests.ps1`
- Smoke run (if applicable): Not run (functional changes limited to verification harness).

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Capture BOYO snapshots during the next ingestion dry-run so coverage thresholds can be increased beyond the current single-site default.
