## Plan
- Reproduce the user-reported database creation warnings after removing site .accdb files.
- Trace the creation pathway in DatabaseModule to confirm why Access creation fails when ADOX is unavailable.
- Add a resilient fallback and re-run the WPF app plus persistence tests to verify clean startup.

## Changes
- `Modules/DatabaseModule.psm1`: added `Invoke-AccessDatabase32BitCreation` helper and taught `New-AccessDatabase` to fall back to a 32-bit PowerShell worker when ADOX creation fails under 64-bit.

## Validation
- `Invoke-Pester Modules/Tests/ParserPersistenceModule.Tests.ps1`
- `Main/MainWindow.ps1` (with Data directory emptied beforehand)

## Outcome
- Database recreation now succeeds even on hosts without 64-bit ADOX support by delegating to the 32-bit runtime; no telemetry or persistence warnings observed after rerun.
