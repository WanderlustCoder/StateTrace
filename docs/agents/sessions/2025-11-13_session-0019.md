# Session 2025-11-13 15:56 MT

- **Plans / Tasks:** ST-D-003, ST-D-010
- **Command:** `pwsh Tools/Analyze-DispatchHarnessSweep.ps1 -SweepPath Logs\DispatchHarness\RoutingQueueSweep-20251113.json -OutputPath docs\performance\DispatchHarnessSweepOrder-20251113.md`
- **Notes:** New sweep-order report shows the harness executed all WLLS hosts before BOYO (streak of 5), matching the telemetry starvation. Copied the markdown into `Logs/TelemetryBundles/Release-20251113/Telemetry/` and referenced it in Plan D + Task Board entries so the scheduler investigation has concrete harness evidence.
