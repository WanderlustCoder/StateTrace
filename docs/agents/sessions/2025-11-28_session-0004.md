# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-28
- **Role:** Telemetry / Automation
- **Task board card:** ST-H-003 (Plan H) – Instrument user-facing telemetry

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Ensure telemetry bundles pick up UserAction summaries automatically.
- Wire through New/Publish bundle scripts.
- Keep changes minimal and optional.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - Tools/Publish-TelemetryBundle.ps1
  - Tools/New-TelemetryBundle.ps1
- Rationale:
  - Added `UserActionSummaryPath` support so bundles can include UserAction summaries; default discovery grabs the latest `UserActionSummary*.json` from reports/history.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (script wiring).
- Smoke run: Not run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Generate a UserAction summary after the next UI run and include it in bundles to satisfy Plan H gates.
