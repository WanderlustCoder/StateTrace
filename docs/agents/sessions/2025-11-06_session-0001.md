# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-06
- **Role:** Automation
- **Task board card:** Prune redundant log fixtures and transcripts

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Inventory `Logs/` for unused clones, debug transcripts, and obsolete snapshots to uphold Documentation Primacy before touching artifacts.
- Confirm parser workers and Pester coverage rely only on the canonical fixtures so the cleanup honors Security & data hygiene.
- Delete redundant assets and document the changes (Task Board + session log) to satisfy Plan-first collaboration expectations.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md
  - docs/agents/sessions/2025-11-06_session-0001.md
- Rationale:
  - Captured the cleanup on the Task Board and in this session log; removed only ignored `Logs/` artifacts (clone fixtures, warm-run transcripts, stale snapshots) so required seeds remain intact.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (documentation-only plus ignored log deletions).
- Smoke run (if applicable): Not run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Monitor future ingestion runs for freshly generated duplicate logs; automate cleanup if tooling keeps recreating them.
