# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-13
- **Role:** Routing telemetry / Release automation
- **Task board card:** ST-A-005 (queue guard) + ST-A-006 dependency

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Produce an artifact (`QueueDelaySummary-<timestamp>.json`) every time the verification harness runs so routing telemetry can be bundled without manual exports.
- Teach `Tools\Publish-TelemetryBundle.ps1`/`Tools\New-TelemetryBundle.ps1` to ingest the new summary automatically (especially for `-AreaName Routing`).
- Update Plan A/E/G docs, the runbook, automation matrix, and Task Board entries so operators know to capture the summary path.

## Changes
- Code: `Tools/Invoke-StateTraceVerification.ps1` (queue summary path/param, helper functions, pass-thru metadata), `Tools/Publish-TelemetryBundle.ps1`, `Tools/New-TelemetryBundle.ps1`.
- Docs: `docs/plans/PlanA_RoutingReliability.md`, `docs/plans/PlanE_Telemetry.md`, `docs/plans/PlanG_ReleaseGovernance.md`, `docs/plans/PlanIndex.md`, `docs/CODEX_PLAN_AUTOMATION_MATRIX.md`, `docs/CODEX_RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/telemetry/Automation_Gates.md`, `docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md`, `docs/taskboard/TaskBoard.csv`.
- Session evidence: this log entry references the new workflow; no telemetry commands were executed because we focused on tooling.

## Validation
- Unit tests were not re-run (changes live in tooling scripts; no module logic altered). Next verification run should confirm the JSON summary is emitted and bundler picks it up.

## Outcome
- Status: ST-A-005 remains In Progress (guard implemented + summary export ready); ST-A-006 prerequisites met (routing bundles auto-ingest queue summaries).
- Follow-ups: Execute the pipeline/dispatcher harness soon to produce fresh telemetry and drop `QueueDelaySummary-<timestamp>.json` + dispatcher logs into a routing bundle for ST-A-006.
