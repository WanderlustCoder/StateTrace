# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** UI / Telemetry
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Enrich the freshness label with cache provider/source details from telemetry.
- Make the label robust to newline-delimited telemetry and show timestamps in the tooltip.
- Update Plan H timeline with the new evidence.

## Changes
- Files touched: Main/MainWindow.ps1 (freshness indicator now reads cache provider/reason + timestamp from the latest telemetry file with newline-JSON fallback; tooltip shows provider, reason, metrics path, and timestamp).
- Docs: Plan H timeline updated (`docs/plans/PlanH_UserExperience.md`) to record the freshness source detail change.

## Validation
- Manual reasoning: label still falls back to ingestion history source; if telemetry is available, provider/reason/timestamp are shown in the tooltip; `Get-SiteCacheProviderFromMetrics` now caches per-log and parses newline JSON.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Capture live WPF screenshots of the updated freshness tooltip; ensure telemetry logs include cache provider/reason during UI runs.
