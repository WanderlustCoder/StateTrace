# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** UI / Telemetry
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001, ST-H-003

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Provide a detached launcher so the WPF UI can stay open despite CLI timeouts.
- Document capture constraints and the interactive workflow.

## Changes
- Added `Tools/Launch-MainWindow.ps1` to start the UI in a separate `powershell.exe` with `-Sta`/`-NoExit`, avoiding CLI timeouts.
- Added `docs/notes/2025-11-26_ui_capture_constraints.md` describing the non-interactive limitation and how to use the launcher from an RDP/console session to perform Plan H captures.

## Validation
- Documentation + helper only; UI still cannot be driven in this headless session. Use from an interactive desktop to proceed with capture.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: On a desktop-capable session, run `pwsh -NoLogo -File Tools/Launch-MainWindow.ps1 -NoExit` then follow `docs/runbooks/PlanH_UI_Capture_Local.md` to capture screenshots/telemetry and publish the next bundle.
