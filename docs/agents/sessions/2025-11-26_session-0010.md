# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** Telemetry
- **Task board card:** ST-H-003

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Add rollup coverage checks for UserAction required actions.
- Validate the new rollup output against existing telemetry.
- Update gates/runbook with enforcement details.

## Changes
- Files touched: Tools/Rollup-IngestionMetrics.ps1 (UserActionCoverage metric with required set), docs/runbooks/UserAction_Telemetry.md (rollup coverage note), docs/telemetry/Automation_Gates.md (Plan H gate now cites coverage metric).
- Rationale: Make daily rollups flag missing UserAction actions so adoption gates can be enforced without manual inspection.

## Validation
- Command: `pwsh -NoLogo -File Tools/Rollup-IngestionMetrics.ps1 -MetricFile Logs/IngestionMetrics/2025-11-26.json -OutputPath Logs/IngestionMetrics/IngestionMetricsSummary-useraction-20251126.csv -IncludePerSite`
  - `Metric=UserActionCoverage`: All scope (Count 6/6, Notes 'All required actions present'); BOYO missing ScanLogs; WLLS missing LoadFromDb/HelpQuickstart.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Keep future telemetry/bundles on the coverage-aware schema; use coverage rows to gate releases; backfill per-site action coverage as UI runs become available.
