# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **Role:** Tooling
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001, ST-H-003

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Add a Plan H readiness enforcement switch to the bundle publisher.
- Document the enforcement path in the runbook.

## Changes
- `Tools/Publish-TelemetryBundle.ps1`: new `-VerifyPlanHReadiness` switch (and required action override). Forces bundle creation with PassThru and calls `Tools/Test-PlanHReadiness.ps1`; fails the publish if UserAction/freshness evidence is missing.
- `docs/CODEX_RUNBOOK.md`: notes to use `-VerifyPlanHReadiness` when publishing bundles that must satisfy Plan H gates.

## Validation
- Intentional re-run against existing bundle skipped (bundle name collision without -Force); readiness still covered by `Tools/Test-PlanHReadiness.ps1` on `UI-20251126-useraction8` (Ready).

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Use `-VerifyPlanHReadiness` on future bundle publishes; include `-Force` when reusing bundle names.
