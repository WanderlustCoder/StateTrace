# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-27
- **Role:** UI / Docs
- **Task board card:** ST-H-001 – Launch user onboarding + freshness visibility

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Provide a screenshot capture guide for the onboarding/quickstart evidence (Documentation Primacy).
- Keep expectations lightweight and aligned with Plan H.
- Record timeline progress.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - docs/runbooks/Onboarding_Screenshots.md
  - docs/plans/PlanH_UserExperience.md
- Rationale:
  - Added a runbook for onboarding screenshots (toolbar freshness label, incremental loading, Help window) and logged the step in Plan H.

## Validation
- Unit tests: Not run (docs only).
- Smoke run: Not run.

## Outcome
- Status: Done (incremental progress on ST-H-001)
- Follow-ups: Capture screenshots per the runbook and wire adoption telemetry to close ST-H-001.
