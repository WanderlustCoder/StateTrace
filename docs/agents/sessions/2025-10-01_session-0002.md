# Agent Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-10-01
- **Role:** Coordinator / Docs / Automation
- **Task board card:** **Document concurrency override workflow** - [Docs][Automation] Summarise pipeline/manual override usage in contributor guides. Deliverable: updates to `docs/README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Coordinator: Capture current override guidance from `docs/StateTrace_Consolidated_Plans.md` and prepare documentation targets.
- Docs Specialist: Update `docs/README.md` with a short how-to on override switches and telemetry expectations.
- Automation Liaison: Mirror the instructions into `AGENTS.md`, noting when to enable overrides during ingestion validation.
- QA/Editor: Proofread the new sections and record actions plus follow-ups in this session log and the task board.

## Changes
- Files touched:
  - docs/README.md
  - AGENTS.md
  - docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md
  - docs/agents/sessions/2025-10-01_session-0002.md
- Rationale:
  - Document how to drive manual concurrency overrides so agents can run controlled ingestion experiments without editing `StateTraceSettings.json`.

## Validation
- Review: Updated sections double-checked for formatting, links, and command syntax.

## Outcome
- Status: Done
- Follow-ups: Consider extending README with screenshots/metrics once real override trials are documented.
