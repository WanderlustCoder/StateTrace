# Codex Backlog (Automation-Ready)

Use this list to queue work that Codex (or another automation agent) can execute with minimal hand-off. Each entry must also exist on the task board/CSV and in the relevant plan file.

| ID | Plan | Title | Preconditions | Definition of done | Notes |
|----|------|-------|---------------|--------------------|-------|
| ST-B-001 | Plan B | Investigate WLLS snapshot/materialize regression | Cold history reset, access to BOYO/WLLS corpus (with `SkipSiteCacheUpdate` disabled) | Cold + warm run metrics captured, cache adoption proven, Plan B + task board updated | Added `Set-InterfaceBulkChunkSize` (ParserPersistence) + `Set-InterfacePortStreamChunkSize` (DeviceRepository) so parser hints drive DeviceRepository batching; latest cold run (`Tools/Invoke-StateTracePipeline.ps1 -SkipTests -VerboseParsing -ResetExtractedLogs -DisableSharedCacheSnapshot`, 2025-11-12 ~15:14 MT) shows 50 WLLS hosts with `SiteCacheFetchDurationMs` avg 336 ms (max 471 ms) and `SiteCacheProvider=Refreshed`. `Tools/Invoke-WarmRunRegression.ps1 -VerboseParsing` still fails because the warm pass reports 268 hosts without `SiteCacheProvider=Cache` / 412 without host-map signature matches—need to fix cache adoption before collecting new warm telemetry. |
| ST-B-002 | Plan B | Trial reduced auto-scale ceilings post-batching | Ability to run pipeline with overrides | Benchmark run recorded, recommendation documented, overrides reset | Command examples in `docs/CODEX_RUNBOOK.md`. |
| ST-A-001 | Plan A | Verify InterfaceSync timing completeness | Dispatcher harness ready | 37 InterfaceSyncTiming events logged, queue latency recorded, plan updated | Requires `Tools/Invoke-StateTracePipeline.ps1 -ResetExtractedLogs`. |
| ST-B-008 | Plan B | Publish warm-run telemetry bundles | Latest cold + warm telemetry files plus analyzer output available | `Tools/Publish-TelemetryBundle.ps1` executed after each run (auto-discovers logs, analyzer JSON, diff hotspot CSV, doc-sync notes) with README referencing plan/task IDs | Bundle path recorded in Plans B/E/G and Task Board row. |
| ST-E-003 | Plan E | Schedule the daily rollup harness | Windows Task Scheduler/CI access plus telemetry directory path | `Tools/Invoke-DailyRollupScheduled.ps1 -Days 1 -IncludePerSite -IncludeSiteCache` (wrapper over `Tools/Invoke-DailyMetricRollup.ps1`) scheduled run documented, bundle updated with latest CSV path | Plan/task board updated with cadence + latest summary file. |
| ST-E-007 | Plan E | Release-readiness telemetry bundle | Rollup CSV, analyzer outputs, warm-run telemetry, doc-sync notes captured | `Tools/Publish-TelemetryBundle.ps1` run with all required artifacts, README + manifest cite plan references, runbook `docs/runbooks/Telemetry_Bundle_Verification.md` completed | Links recorded in Plans E/G and Task Board entry (include README hash + readiness output). |
| ST-G-001 | Plan G | Update release checklist with shared cache snapshot policy | Release checklist in `docs/Release.md` | Shared cache snapshot verification steps added (summary JSON + guard command); Task Board + Plan G updated | Done 2025-12-22: `docs/Release.md` references `SharedCacheSnapshot-latest-summary.json` and `Tools\Test-SharedCacheSnapshot.ps1`. |
| ST-G-002 | Plan G | Link roadmap milestones to task board IDs | Q4 roadmap milestones + task board rows | Roadmap table updated with Task Board IDs; Task Board/CSV now include milestone cards (ST-A-007/ST-B-010/ST-C-001) | Done 2025-12-22: `docs/StateTrace_Quarterly_Roadmap.md` and Task Board updated. |
| ST-G-006 | Plan G | Doc-sync enforcement hook | Task board + plan IDs available | Doc-sync checklist tool validates plan/task board/backlog/session log updates and emits JSON summary; `Tools\Invoke-AllChecks.ps1` supports `-RequireDocSyncChecklist`; runbook/playbook/checklist updated | Done 2025-12-22: `Tools/Test-DocSyncChecklist.ps1` + AllChecks hook. |
| ST-H-001 | Plan H | Launch user onboarding + freshness visibility | Onboarding harness uses sample Access corpus; UI help link wired to Operators runbook | Quickstart anchor + headless checklist summary (`-SummaryPath`) published; toolbar Help opens the quickstart anchor; freshness label shows last ingest/age per site; onboarding screenshots staged at `docs/performance/screenshots/onboarding-20251126-154036-*.png`. Next: add cache-source telemetry and refresh screenshots from the WPF shell. | Aligns with task board/Plan H; latest bundle `Logs/TelemetryBundles/UI-20251126-useraction9/` carries quickstart outputs, UserAction coverage, freshness summary, and `PlanHReadiness.json`. |

Add new items by cloning the row, linking to the appropriate plan, and updating the CSV/task board.
