# StateTrace Routing Discovery Solo Workplan

## Purpose
- Guide a self-led discovery exercise to clarify routing reliability goals, definitions, and current telemetry gaps.

## Session Structure
- Run sessions when you have focus time; repeat as insights evolve
- Suggested format: two 45-minute focus blocks with a short break
- Location: personal workspace (no external attendees)

## Focus Areas
1. Define primary vs. secondary routes and desired detection latency.
2. Inventory existing routing telemetry (synthetic probes, SNMP polling, logs).
3. Map current escalation paths and incident documentation habits.
4. Capture compliance or retention constraints relevant to routing data.

## Preparation Checklist
- Gather recent routing incident notes/logs.
- Export current monitoring configurations for reference.
- Review routing sections in `docs/StateTrace_Functions_Features.md` for system context.

## Artifacts to Produce
- Notes stored at `docs/notes/2025-10-04_routing-discovery.md`.
- Updated risk/assumption list appended to `docs/StateTrace_Routing_Reliability_Plan.md` if needed.
- Action list added at the end of this document once discovery completes.

## Follow-Up Suggestions
- Revisit findings weekly to validate assumptions as implementation starts.
- Turn action items into backlog entries with due dates.
