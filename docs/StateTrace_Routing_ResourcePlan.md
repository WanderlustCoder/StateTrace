# StateTrace Routing Reliability Resource Plan

## Purpose
Outline how a single operator will cover the responsibilities required to deliver the routing reliability milestones.

## Capacity Focus Areas
- **Backend/Parser work:** Data model, health evaluation logic, Access persistence.
- **Telemetry & SRE tasks:** Signal ingestion scripts, monitoring dashboards, alert tuning.
- **UI/UX build:** Routing dashboard layout, detail panel wiring, acknowledgement controls.
- **Program & documentation:** Planning, note-taking, risk tracking, status journaling.
- **Support/runbook updates:** Refresh routing runbooks, prepare validation drills.

Treat these as rotating focus areas and rebalance as progress evolves.

## Cadence Suggestions
- Periodically review discovery notes and architecture drafts; capture updates directly in the docs.
- Use end-of-week retrospectives to log accomplishments and rescope upcoming work.

## Next Actions
- Prioritize which focus area to address next and note it in this document.
- Track progress by adding inline comments (e.g., "[Updated 2025-09-28]") when a section moves forward.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Overcommitment:** Re-balance scope if weekly hours exceed capacity; prioritize telemetry and backend foundations first.
- **Skill context switching:** Group similar tasks into themed days (e.g., telemetry Tuesdays) to reduce cognitive load.
- **Sustainability:** Schedule breaks and retrospectives to avoid burnout; capture improvement ideas in notes.

## Review Cadence
- Revisit capacity plan every Friday; update status column accordingly.
