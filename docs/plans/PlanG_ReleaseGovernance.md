# Plan G - Release & Governance

## Objective
Maintain a predictable release cadence, ensure warm-run verification passes before packaging, and document rollout decisions (approvals, risk assessments, governance) so every build is auditable.

## Current status (2025-11)
- Release guide (`docs/Release.md`) plus the Codex documentation controls (`docs/CODEX_DOC_SYNC_PLAYBOOK.md`, `docs/CODEX_PLAN_AUTOMATION_MATRIX.md`, `docs/CODEX_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`) describe the governance loop, but the release checklist still lacks explicit shared-cache snapshot and verification evidence requirements.
- Governance artifacts live in `docs/RiskRegister.md`, `docs/StateTrace_Quarterly_Roadmap.md`, and `docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md`; Plan G must keep those aligned by mirroring TaskBoard IDs inside the roadmap and referencing the same IDs when publishing release notes.
- Warm-run verification is part of the standard harness (`Tools/Invoke-StateTracePipeline.ps1 -RunWarmRunRegression`, `Tools/Invoke-StateTraceVerification.ps1`, `Tools/Invoke-StateTraceScheduledVerification.ps1`), yet we do not consistently archive the resulting telemetry (cold vs warm JSON, verification summaries, shared-cache summaries) in a release evidence bundle.
- Shared cache analyzers (`Tools/Analyze-SharedCacheStoreState.ps1`, `Tools/Analyze-SiteCacheProviderReasons.ps1`) and rollups feed governance calls, but Plan G still needs a standing task that captures their output for every release candidate.
- Plan E’s telemetry bundles and Plan B’s analyzer outputs are prerequisites for sign-off; Plan G must enforce that every candidate build references `Logs/TelemetryBundles/<date>/` (created via `Tools\Publish-TelemetryBundle.ps1`) before approvals.

## Near-term execution detail

### ST-G-007 — Telemetry bundle enforcement
- **Checklist updates:** Amend `docs/Release.md` to add a gated step titled "Telemetry Bundle Verification" that requires the current bundle folder (e.g., `Logs\TelemetryBundles\2025-11-13.1\`) plus README hash, warm/cold telemetry IDs, shared-cache analyzer filenames, diff-hotspot CSV, doc-sync checklist artifact, and routing evidence. Link this step back to TaskBoard rows ST-E-007/ST-E-009 so ownership is traceable.
- **Routing evidence:** Every routing bundle must now include `Logs\IngestionMetrics\QueueDelaySummary-<timestamp>.json` (plus dispatcher harness outputs) so the queue-delay gate proof is immutable; `Tools\Publish-TelemetryBundle.ps1 -AreaName Routing` auto-discovers the summary file. Follow `docs/runbooks/Telemetry_Bundle_Verification.md` for the exact payload list.
- **Automated guard:** Run `pwsh Tools\Test-TelemetryBundleReadiness.ps1 -BundlePath Logs\TelemetryBundles\<bundle> -Area Telemetry,Routing -IncludeReadmeHash -SummaryPath Logs\TelemetryBundles\<bundle>\VerificationSummary.json` (or `Tools\Invoke-AllChecks.ps1 -TelemetryBundlePath Logs\TelemetryBundles\<bundle> -RequireTelemetryBundleReady`) to scan the candidate bundle for required files, emit README hashes, and block releases when artifacts are missing. Integrate the script output with `Tools\Invoke-StateTraceVerification.ps1 -ReleaseReadiness` once CI hooks are wired up; track command usage inside this plan and `docs/CODEX_PLAN_AUTOMATION_MATRIX.md`.
- **Bundle manifest:** Require each bundle README to list command lines, timestamps, TaskBoard IDs (ST-A-006, ST-E-003/7/8/9, ST-G-007), and hashes for every analyzer/CSV/log. Store the README hash (and link to `VerificationSummary.json`) in `docs/Release.md` and surface it on the release checklist so approvers can compare it against the filesystem copy.
- **Doc-sync proof:** Require every release bundle README to embed the doc-sync checklist output (per `docs/CODEX_DOC_SYNC_PLAYBOOK.md`) and store the generated JSON under `Logs\TelemetryBundles\<bundle>\DocSync\`. Releases without this artifact must halt until the checklist is rerun.
- **Cross-plan linkage:** Mirror the bundle path inside Plan A (ST-A-006) and Plan E (ST-E-003/7/9) timelines whenever routing or telemetry evidence is produced so auditors see a single breadcrumb trail. Update `docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md` and `docs/CODEX_BACKLOG.md` entries to cite the same bundle ID the release checklist expects, and reference the bundle again in `docs/PlanIndex.md` so future agents know which evidence set closes the loop.
- **Evidence trail:** Append a "Telemetry bundle produced?" column to `docs/StateTrace_TaskBoard.md` release rows; entries should include the bundle path + README hash. Also capture bundle metadata (hashes, manifest path, verification timestamp) in `docs/Release.md` change history and `docs/CODEX_PLAN_AUTOMATION_MATRIX.md` (Plan G row) to satisfy governance reviews.
- **Audit helper:** `Tools\Show-TelemetryBundleSummary.ps1 -BundlePath Logs\TelemetryBundles\<bundle>` prints the README hashes + requirement table that were stored in `VerificationSummary.json`; attach this output (or link to the JSON) to release records for quick review.

## Automation hooks
- `Tools\Invoke-StateTracePipeline.ps1 -RunWarmRunRegression -ShowSharedCacheSummary [-SharedCacheSnapshotPath Logs\SharedCacheSnapshot\SharedCacheSnapshot-latest.clixml]` before tagging any build; archive the cold and warm telemetry JSON files under `Logs/ReleaseEvidence/<version>/`.
- `Tools\Invoke-StateTraceVerification.ps1 -SharedCacheMinimumSiteCount 2 -SharedCacheRequiredSites BOYO,WLLS -EmitWarmRunTelemetry` to enforce gates and produce `VerificationSummary-*.json` for the evidence bundle.
- `Tools\Invoke-StateTraceScheduledVerification.ps1 -Daily -WarmRun -OutputDirectory Logs\Verification` so governance has fresh telemetry even outside manual release windows.
- `Tools\Invoke-SharedCacheWarmup.ps1 -ShowSharedCacheSummary -RequiredSites BOYO,WLLS` prior to packaging; attach the summary output.
- `Tools\Analyze-SharedCacheStoreState.ps1 -Path Logs\IngestionMetrics\<file>.json -IncludeSiteBreakdown` and `Tools\Analyze-SiteCacheProviderReasons.ps1 -IncludeHostBreakdown` after each candidate to document shared-cache health alongside the release record.
- `Tools\Invoke-DailyMetricRollup.ps1` / `Tools\Rollup-IngestionMetrics.ps1` + `Tools\Publish-TelemetryBundle.ps1`: gather the latest rollup CSV, analyzer output, warm-run summaries, and doc-sync checklist reports into `Logs/TelemetryBundles/<date>/` and reference the folder inside the release checklist.
- Apply `docs/CODEX_DOC_SYNC_PLAYBOOK.md` before approvals (plan entry, task board, backlog + session log updates) and record the checklist output in the telemetry bundle README.

## Telemetry gates
- Warm vs cold regression improvement >= 60 percent with `WarmProviderCounts.Cache` covering every processed host; copy the improvement line into the release notes.
- Shared cache snapshot summary (`SharedCacheSnapshot-*-summary.json`) shows minimum site count 2, host count 37, row count >= 1200 before release artifacts are signed.
- `Logs/Verification/VerificationSummary-*.json` (or CLI output) shows `Tools\Invoke-StateTraceVerification.ps1` passed with zero skipped assertions; failures block release until resolved.
- Release checklist (`docs/Release.md`) completed and linked to the TaskBoard along with the doc-sync checklist output (per `docs/CODEX_DOC_SYNC_PLAYBOOK.md`).
- Risk register entry updated if the release introduces new mitigations or residual risk; link the row number in the release announcement.
- Telemetry bundle check: `Logs/TelemetryBundles/<version>/` exists and includes rollup CSV, shared-cache analyzer output, warm-run telemetry summary, diff hotspot CSV, and doc-sync checklist artifact before sign-off.
- Doc-sync evidence recorded: bundle README lists plan/backlog/task-board/session-log links per `docs/CODEX_DOC_SYNC_PLAYBOOK.md`.
