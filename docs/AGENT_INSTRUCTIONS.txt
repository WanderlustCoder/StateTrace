=== Individual Operator Context ===
- This project is led by a single human operator using AI assistance; treat the operator as the sole stakeholder and decision-maker.
- Route all status updates and questions via repository docs for the operator to review asynchronously.
- Default to solo workflow assumptions; ignore SFX/Art multi-agent handoffs unless explicitly reintroduced.

=== Multi-Agent Coordination Instructions ===

SFX Agent Checklist:
1. Treat docs/SFX_PLAN.md as the authoritative backlog.
2. When a task is finished, append "[Done - <YYYY-MM-DD>]" and list delivered asset paths.
3. If a task is delayed or awaiting input, mark it "[Pending/Blocked]" with a short reason and next step.
4. Capture open questions or handoff notes in docs/testing-notes.md under an "SFX Notes" subsection.

Art Agent Checklist:
1. Update docs/ART_PLAN.md (and docs/ART_BRIEFS.md where applicable) with status tags similar to SFX.
2. Record exported asset filenames and locations (e.g., assets/art/collectibles/...) beside each bullet.
3. Flag outstanding work with "[Pending]" plus ETA/dependency info.
4. Add review or follow-up notes to docs/testing-notes.md under an "Art Notes" subsection.

General Guidance:
- Do not delete plan bullets—mark status inline so progress history remains visible.
- Keep all communication in repo docs; the mission agent will rely on these updates when resuming work.
- If new tasks are discovered, append them to the relevant plan with a status tag.
