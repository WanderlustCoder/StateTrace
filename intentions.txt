I understand your intentions clearly. You’re envisioning a comprehensive network management GUI that goes well beyond just parsing logs. The idea is to have an integrated tool that:

Generates Command Sets:
With a button click, the GUI would dynamically create sets of commands to be sent to your devices. These commands could be used to collect logs, retrieve device information (like software version, inventory details, model number, etc.), or even change configurations.

Displays Device Logs and Data:
The logs and additional data (such as software versions, inventory details, and model information) pulled from the devices would be presented within the GUI—likely in separate tabs or forms—for easy review. This display would allow you to quickly assess the current state and configuration of your devices.

Offers Configuration Changes Directly via the GUI:
Using additional buttons and forms within the GUI, you could generate commands to modify device configurations. This means that after reviewing the logs and device details, you can immediately push changes back to the device without having to switch contexts.

Key Components of Your Intended Tool
Multi-Tab Interface:
A central GUI with multiple tabs—for instance, one for log generation and viewing, another for device inventory/status, and another for configuration changes. Each tab would be tailored to one specific function.

Interactive Controls:
Buttons, forms, and possibly dropdowns that let you:

Trigger log generation commands.

Refresh or import logs into the GUI.

View detailed device information (inventory, model, firmware, etc.).

Execute configuration change commands, potentially with confirmation dialogs or feedback panels.

Data Parsing and Aggregation:
The backend logic (which you’ve already developed for parsing Cisco and Brocade logs) would feed into this GUI. In addition, you’d extend that logic to capture and display extra device details like software version, inventory, and model information. This data can be displayed in tables or forms, and even exported if needed.

Integration and Workflow Automation:
The goal is to seamlessly move from one action to the next. For example, you might click a button to pull logs, review the logs in a well-organized display, and then decide to push configuration changes—all from within a single integrated application.

Technology Considerations
Since you’re working in PowerShell (v5), you might consider using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or Windows Forms (WinForms) for your GUI. Both options have their pros and cons:

WinForms:

Easier to implement and well-supported in PowerShell v5.

Sufficient for most straightforward GUI tasks (tabs, buttons, data grids).

WPF:

Offers a more modern look and richer UI capabilities.

Might require a steeper learning curve but is more flexible for advanced GUI design.

Next Steps
Based on our discussion, the next logical steps could be:

Define the GUI Layout:
Sketch out the layout of your application—identify what tabs and controls you need. For example, one tab for “Log Generation & Review,” one for “Device Inventory & Status,” and one for “Configuration Changes.”

Determine Data Sources:
Make sure that the data you want (software version, model, inventory, etc.) is reliably output by your devices, or that you have a method to query that data. This may involve extending your current log parsing scripts or running additional commands.

Prototype in PowerShell:
Start building a prototype using PowerShell’s WinForms or WPF. Create a simple form with a few buttons and text boxes to test command generation and data display.

Integrate Parsing Logic:
Gradually integrate your existing parsing functions into the GUI so that when you click buttons the corresponding commands are sent out and their responses are fed back into the interface.

Iterate and Extend:
Once the basic functionalities work (generating commands, pulling logs, displaying device details), you can start adding more sophisticated features like error logging, notifications, and data export options.

I hope this overview captures your vision accurately. If you’d like, I can help craft a basic prototype or provide more detailed guidance on any specific aspect of the GUI development. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
