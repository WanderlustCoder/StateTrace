# Agent Session Log
- **Date:** 2025-12-23
- **Role:** Telemetry
- **Task board card:** ST-E-007 / ST-E-009 / ST-G-007 — Publish Release-2025-12-23 Telemetry + Routing bundles and record readiness.

## Plan (3-6 bullets)
- Generate shared-cache analyzer + site-provider summaries from Logs/IngestionMetrics/2025-12-23.json and a warm-run diff hotspot CSV.
- Publish Telemetry + Routing bundles for Release-2025-12-23 with routing dispatcher logs and doc-sync evidence.
- Run Tools/Test-TelemetryBundleReadiness.ps1 with README hashes + summary output.
- Update Plan E/Plan G + TaskBoard entries with bundle hashes and verification evidence.
- Core ideas: Documentation Primacy, Telemetry & Verification, Plan-first Collaboration.

## Outcome
